# Sp3ctrum_UV-Vis_P4tronus
UV-vis spectra simulation program through oscillator power calculations. This program uses output files from the Gaussian packet and makes Gaussian convolutions to generate simulation of UV-vis spectra.

Unzip the folder in the Home folder and edit .bash_rc (linux) or .bash_profile (macOS) with the following line:

alias sp3ctrum_app='python3 ~/sp3ctrum_UV-Vis_P4tronus/sp3ctrum_app.py'

After that, just run the sp3ctrum_app command in the folder where the .log files are located.
